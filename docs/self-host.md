# fragment self-hosted

Self-hosting runs master's cell on other implementations of the interfaces
it is written against. It lands on master seam by seam: each is switched
on by configuration, and master's Cloudflare path is unchanged. Where this
disagrees with `docs/cloudflare-v1.md`, that doc wins.

## The rule: one cell, interfaces, placement as configuration

The cell is written against Cloudflare's runtime APIs (Durable Objects,
the Worker Loader and facets, Workflows, Queues, R2, `ctx.container`) and
protocols for what sits outside a runtime (OpenAI's chat completions, the
code-store contract, the DevTools Protocol, Web Push). Self-hosting
supplies other implementations of the same interfaces. The cell never
asks "am I self-hosted?": it reads what it has from its configuration and
its bindings. A mode flag is a design bug.

The e2e checks the cell without a service on wrangler too: its `unbound`
section restarts the node with those bindings left out of its config
(`devstack::Fleet::unbound`), so master's own runs keep each degradation
working.

## Mail

Master mails through Email Sending's binding (`EMAIL`), or in dev and the
e2e through the fake. A self-hosted deployment has neither: `mail::send`
sends nothing, logs one `mail.unsent` warning ("email not sent: this
runtime has no mailer, not yet implemented") and answers no message id,
never an error. An invite still waits for its person's yes; a key is still
added; an org's `mailed` and a trial's `sent` say false. Debt:
docs/technical-debt-ledger.md, "No mail without Email Sending".
